# Hero-Quest
2D RPG Game

This is a 2d rpg game made in python using pygame library. I made this to improve my object oriented programming skills. 
Game is not finished, but even in this version it has login/register(fully working all written in code using my logic and
linked with mysql database), main menu, leaderboards(pulling info from database), admin page(that only admin can access),
delete accounts and ban options for admins(all updated in real time and linked to database) etc.
